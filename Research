            <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Our methodology will begin with 5 one on one interviews with different participants that meet general requirements listed below for our study. Our team will use a semi-structured method for questioning. We will use a combination or probing and open-ended questions to gain qualitative information. We will also distribute a survey to collect general qualitative data. The survey will be created through a google poll and posted on social networking sites, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp. 
            </p>
              
            <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">The ideal participant will be a frequent mobile application user that is comfortable with technology. They will have enough leisure time to eat out at least once a week. These participants will allow us a greater understanding of the main struggles that the frequent diner is affected by.

            <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i><b>How did you develop interview/survey questions? 
            </b></i></p>
              <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">We developed our interview/survey questions by using our proto-persona and user research plan as a guideline. We first brainstormed problems associated with going out to eat. We then developed research questions that are structured to help our team identify common consumer pain points and possible areas of improvement. 


              <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i><b>What are the key findings you derived from the interview/survey?</b></i>
            </b></p> 
              <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"> We learned that the main two concerns that our target audience has with going out to eat are the following:</p>

                <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">1.) Deciding what and where to eat</p>
                <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">2.) Coming to a group consensus 
                </p> 
                <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i><b>What other products solve a similar problem? How do they compare/contrast?What other products exist in this domain/industry?</b></i></p>
                </p>
                <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><img src="Competitor.png" alt="1MSS" style="width:100%" class="w3-hover-opacity"></p>

                  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">Our main take away from our competitor analysis was that there are very few true competitors that meet the need of group consensus. The closest competitor that we found was Restaurant Roulette and this app lacked a communal aspect to it. All other competitors were indirect and only met a portion of the needs that our target audience expressed to us during our user research phase.

                                            <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">As we were improving the User Experience, we worked on refining the visual design of the app. We developed a rule-based system to support branding, typography, icons, and colors in order to achieve visual consistency with the styling of the app. The system served as a base for the entire user interface used on iOS, iPad, Android devices, the website, and all following marketing materials.</p>

                                          <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">We kept in mind that developing any new feature has a high cost and takes time, so we decided to use an on-boarding experience because it gives the user a guided introduction to the product, sets up some initial preferences, and points out critical elements in the User Interface. We can also reuse this feature in the future to introduce any new elements/features.</p>
